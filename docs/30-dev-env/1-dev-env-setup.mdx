  <summary>ü¶π If you are doing this lab as part of a MongoDB GenAI Developer Day, you can continue in the Codespace you previously created.</summary>

    Navigate to [this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/mdblab?quickstart=1) link. Click the **Resume this codespace** button to resume the code space you created previously.

    Give the codespace a few seconds to restart. When files appear under the Explorer, click the file named `ai-rag-lab.ipynb`. This is the Jupyter Notebook you will be using throughout this lab.

:::tip
In this lab, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, which is an interactive Python environment. If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, use [this](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/vector-search-lab/docs/dev-env/jupyter-notebooks) guide to familiarize yourself with the environment.

:::tip
The MongoDB database needed for his lab is included in the Github Codespace. But If you want to create a free one in MongoDB Atlas, please follow the instructions in our [Intro Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/category/mongodb-atlas)

## Option 1: GitHub Codespaces

You will be working in a Jupyter Notebook in a GitHub Codespace throughout this lab. A codespace is a cloud-hosted, containerized development environment that comes pre-configured with all the tools you need to run this lab.

Navigate to **[this](https://github.com/codespaces/new/mongodb-developer/mdblab?quickstart=1)** link. You will be prompted to sign into GitHub if you haven't already. Once signed in, click the **Create new codespace** button to create a new codespace.

Let it run for a few minutes as it prepares your environment. It will clone the repository, prepare the container, and run the installation scripts. Once the environment is built, you should see a list of files appear under the Explorer.

In the left navigation bar of the IDE, click on the file named `notebooks/AI Labs/ai-rag-lab.ipynb` to open the Jupyter Notebook for this lab.

Next, select the Python interpreter by clicking **Select Kernel** at the top right of the IDE.

In the modal that appears, click **Python environments...** and select the interpreter that is marked as **Recommended** or **Global Env**.

### That's it! You're ready for the lab! ##

  <summary>ü¶π Option 2: Run locally</summary>
  <div>

    :::caution
    During the lab, we will use GitHub Codespaces. These instructions are here just in case you can't use Codespaces, or if you really, really, really want a local installation.

    You'll need to use your own MongoDB database; you can get a free one by follow the instructions in our [Intro Lab](https://mongodb-developer.github.io/intro-lab/docs/category/mongodb-atlas)
    :::

    If you want to run the notebook locally, follow the steps below:

    * Clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git) for this lab by executing the following command from the terminal:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/mongodb-developer/genai-devday-notebooks.git
    ```

    * `cd` into the cloned directory:

    ```
    cd genai-devday-notebooks
    ```

    * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```
    python -m venv vector-search-lab
    source vector-search-lab/bin/activate
    ```

    * Install the dependencies for this lab:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    * Install and launch Jupyter Notebook:

    ```
    pip install notebook
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    * In the browser tab that pops up, open the file named `vector-search-lab.ipynb`.
