# 👐 Create a vector search index

To retrieve documents from MongoDB using vector search, you must configure a vector search index on the collection into which you ingested your data. The recommended way to do this is via the MongoDB drivers.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 6: Create a vector search index** section in the notebook to create a vector search index.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_8**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
collection.create_search_index(model=model)
```
</div>
</details>

To verify that the index was created, navigate to the **Overview** page in the Atlas UI. In the **Clusters section**, select your cluster and click **Browse collections**.
