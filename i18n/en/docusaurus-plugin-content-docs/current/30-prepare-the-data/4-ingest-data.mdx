# üëê Ingest data into MongoDB

The final step to build a MongoDB vector store for the chatbot is to ingest the embedded article chunks into MongoDB.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 5: Ingest data into MongoDB** section in the notebook to ingest the embedded documents into MongoDB.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_5**

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
<div>
```python
collection.insert_many(embedded_docs)
```
</div>
</details>

To visually verify that the data has been imported into the MongoDB cluster, click the leaf icon in the left navigation bar of the IDE.
    
Ensure that you see a database called _mongodb_genai_devday_rag_, and a collection named _knowledge_base_ under it.
