# 🦹 Re-rank retrieved results

Re-rankers are specialized models that are trained to calculate the relevance between query-document pairs. Without re-ranking the order of retrieved results is governed by the embedding model, which isn't optimized for relevance and can lead to poor LLM recall in RAG applications.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **🦹‍♀️ Re-rank retrieved results** section in the notebook to add a re-ranking stage to the chatbot.

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:

**CODE_BLOCK_17**
