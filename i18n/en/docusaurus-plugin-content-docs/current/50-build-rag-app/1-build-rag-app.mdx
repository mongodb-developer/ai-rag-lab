# üëê Build the RAG application

Let's create a simple RAG workflow that takes in a user query, retrieves contextually relevant documents from MongoDB Atlas, and passes the query and retrieved context to an LLM to generate an answer to the user question.

Fill in any `<CODE_BLOCK_N>` placeholders and run the cells under the **Step 8: Build the RAG application** section in the notebook to build the RAG "application".

The answers for code blocks in this section are as follows:
